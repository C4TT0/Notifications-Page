## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to approach a minimal code by creating utility classes and using them to style rather than describing the same style for every component.

### Continued development

Any development/improvement regarding improving reusability of code or making it more minimal or other is welcome.
